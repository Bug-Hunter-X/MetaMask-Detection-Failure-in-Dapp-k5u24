This repository contains a bug report and solution for a common issue in decentralized applications (dApps) where the detection of the MetaMask wallet fails.  The issue arises when the dApp attempts to connect to MetaMask, but the check for MetaMask's presence consistently returns negative, even if MetaMask is correctly installed and enabled. The solution involves ensuring the correct context and timing for accessing the 'ethereum' object.
